Proteins are essential components of life, predicting their 3D structure enables researchers to get an insight into its function and role. AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) system, developed by Google DeepMind, that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure based on its primary amino acid sequence.  It regularly achieves accuracy competitive with experiment.

## Who is this course for?
This tutorial is aimed at researchers who are interested in using AlphaFold to predict protein structures and integrate these predictions into their projects. An undergraduate-level knowledge of protein structure and structural biology would be an advantage.

The content of this course provides an understanding of the fundamental concepts behind AlphaFold, how users can run protein predictions and how AlphaFold has been used to enhance research.

Throughout the course there may be terms used you are unfamiliar with. If so, please review the Glossary of terms of help.

## What will I achieve?
By the end of the course you will be able to:

- Explain how AlphaFold works and its strengths and limitations
- Describe how AlphaFold predictions were validated experimentally
- Discuss the fundamental concepts behind AlphaFold and why it is considered a significant breakthrough in protein structure prediction
- Assess the best way to predict protein structures
- Identify the best way to access pre-computed predictions from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database
- Evaluate predicted structures from AlphaFold by integrating the different confidence metrics
